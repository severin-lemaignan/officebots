As you know,
an investor is coming to the office in a few minutes
and will decide if he wants to invest in our company! 
It is a great day for the team and for the company.
But as you will see, the office is a mess. 
You will have to collect and bring to the kitchen table all objects
 that could be interesting to show him. 
Moreover, I will give each of you some missions to clean the place.  
You will need to talk to your colleagues to be sure you know them well.
Every mission will give you some points. 
When the timer runs out, the player with most points will win!
All missions are not worth the same amount of points.

You can navigate the arena using the arrow keys.
When you approach a character, you may have a discussion with them through the chat.
You can use the emojis to show your emotions and expressions.
You can interact with some objects: either bump into it or collect it 
by clicking on the highlighted yellow circle on the object.
Some missions are using the objects: be careful to select the correct object 
and not a similar one. 
If you get stuck during the game, you can change your mission 
but it will cost you 3 points in your total.  

Good luck !
